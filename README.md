### Class Methods / Attributes

1. Give the `Fish` a class attribute `all_fish` which starts as an empty list.

2. When a new `Fish` is created, append it to `Fish.all_fish`.

3. Create a new class method `num_fish` which returns the length of `Fish.all_fish`.

4. Create a class method `all_fish_names` which returns a list of all the names for `Fish` instances. *HINT: You can use list comprehension for this!*

5. Create a class method `average_length` which returns the average length in inches for all `Fish` instances. *HINT: The average is the sum of lengths / number of fish. There are several ways of getting the average in Python...*
